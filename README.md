Myriad is an open-source standardization, functionality, and mitigations test for executors.

After the discontinuation of [UNC](https://github.com/unified-naming-convention/NamingStandard), multiple forks and continuations of it have popped up, as well as separate general executor tests such as vulnerability tests and identity tests. Myriad hopes to achieve these as one, unified test.

## Script

You can use our official loadstring:

```luau
loadstring(game:HttpGetAsync("https://github.com/Standard-2/Myriad/releases/latest/download/myriad.luau"))()
```

> Myriad testing game: https://www.roblox.com/games/79035306837882
> The reason we use a roblox game for testing is because the executor environment is the very thing being tested, and the roblox environment helps to not rely on the executor as much. (Very simplified and there are many other reasons as well)

Or load the [raw file](https://github.com/Standard-2/Myriad/releases/latest/download/myriad.luau)

## API

You can use our API to easily run tests individually without the UI.
This is helpful if our UI is specifically giving you issues, or if you want to check a user's executor implementation of a certain function.

See our [API Documentation](https://Standard-2.github.io/Myriad/api/)

Example:

```luau
local API = loadstring(game:HttpGetAsync("https://github.com/Standard-2/Myriad/releases/latest/download/api.luau"))()

local result = API.Standards.Checks.Closures.hookfunction()
if result.status ~= 200 then
    warn(`Your executor does not support hookfunction properly: {result.message}`)
end
```

## How do I contribute?

You need [darklua](https://github.com/seaofvoices/darklua) & [Lune](https://github.com/lune-org/lune) to use edit and build this project as it uses [ProCmp](https://github.com/Standard-2/procmp)
